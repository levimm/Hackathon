F:   Hi
M: Hello  
F:How you doing?
M: Great!
F: What do you like?
M:Sports

F: Wanna hear something weird?
M: Always!

F: Ross, just for my own peace of mind — you're not married to any more of us, are you?
M: Okay, you two are asking the court for an annulment?
F: Yes, your honor, and here are... are forms, all filled out.
M: So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
F: Fine, I’m mentally unstable.
M: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
F: What?!
M: Uh, yes, heroin and crack.
F: Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
M: Well, you would know.
F: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
M: Oh, come on!
F: Ross, please, I found the magazines!
M: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin...
F: Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?Passer-by: Maybe because you've got the keys?
