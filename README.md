This application works based on HPE HavenOnDemand APIs. The APIs used are as follows:

analyzesentiment

createtextindex

listresources

deletetextindex

findrelatedconcepts

findsimilar

addtotextindex

recognizeimages

// recomment

// speechrecognition



Basically speaking, it's a smart chatting system. It can analyze the training data(dialogs) and add the resources into it's knowledge base.
When questions are raised, it will analyze the sentiment of the speaker in real time during conversion. For the answers, it will look for the similar questions in the database and list the several answers with the highest scores. 
Some pre-researches about the Female speaker are done in order to help analyze her likes and dislikes. So you can have confidence to hit on HER based on our recommendation.



This application can be easily extended to other areas. For example, training with daily English data and use it to help the ones to learn English 
through talking. Or training with some specific product's knowledge, so it can save the time for the support engineers.
